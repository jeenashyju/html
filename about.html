        <h2>ABOUTUS</h2>
        <h3>Mount Zion College of Engineering and Technology was inaugurated in the year 2001. It is run by Mount Zion Christian Educational Trust. This trust was formed in 1988 with the sole aim of providing education in the educationally backward district of Pudukkottai. The college since its inception has grown in leaps and bounds and is currently one of the best in the region. It strives to make all those who pass through its portals into innovative, hardworking engineers who will be of use to their places of work and to the society at large. Though young, the college has great plans for the future and the management is determined to transform Mount Zion into one of the best engineering institutions in the world./h3>
